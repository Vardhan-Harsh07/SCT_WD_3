# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid.

## 🎮 Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple Interface**: Intuitive layout and easy to understand rules.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A web browser to run the game.

### How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the squares to place their marks (X or O).
3. The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all squares are filled and there’s no winner, the game is a draw.
